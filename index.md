## About Me

I'm a master degree candidate,studying at New York University,majoring Journalism and communication.
This semester, I took a course called Textual Data Analysis. The course instructor, Chen Zhicong <a href="https://zhicongchen.github.io/" target="_blank">, asked us to post our coursework on the github platform, so I created this account.

Outside of academia, I began my journey as a professional swimmer at the age of 5 and went on to achieve several regional and national championships. I'm also passionate about Chinese calligraphy, and my artwork has been exhibited in top galleries and museums including the <a href="http://www.namoc.org/" target="_blank"> National Art Museum of China (Beijing)</a>.
