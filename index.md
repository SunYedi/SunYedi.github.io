## About Me

I'm a master degree candidate,studying at <a href="https://jc.nju.edu.cn/en9/main.htm" target="_blank">School of Journalism and Communication</a>,<a href="https://www.nju.edu.cn/" target="_blank"> Nanjing University </a>.During my undergraduate studies, I majored in Network and New Media at <a href="https://www.bsu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Beijing Sport University</a>, and at the same time, I minored in English.
This semester, I took a course called Textual Data Analysis. The course instructor, <a href="https://zhicongchen.github.io/" target="_blank"> Zhicong Chen </a> , asked us to post our coursework on the github platform, so I created this account.

I am a pure novice when it comes to programming and coding. This semester I hope to learn something on github to help me pass my course exams.

Outside of academia, I like watching anime, reading novels, watching movies, listening to music, listening to podcasts and playing badminton!
